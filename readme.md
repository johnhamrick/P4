#  John Hamrick CSCI E-15 README file for Project 4

The goal of this project is to bring together all of the skills learned throughout the semester to create a fully-functioning web application that uses PHP, Laravel and a database.

**## Task ##**
This project requires the following:

1. Uses PHP/Laravel
1. Uses a database with at least 2 tables (excluding a users table but including pivot tables).
1. Demonstrates all 4 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interactions.  Signup/Login does not count toward this.

# Task Manager #

## Functions Include: ##
 
- User authentication - users have their own lists
- Incomplete tasks page - bold items
- Completed tasks page - greyed out items
- New tasks page
- Edit tasks page


Whenever a task is displayed, it should list the date it was created and if complete, when it was completed.

Use error checking: Don't allow empty tasks, don't allow duplicate email sign-ups, etc.
